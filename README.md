WHAT IS VUEJS?

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.

It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.
